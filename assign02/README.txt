    Unique aspects of implementation

    Utilization of vector in String array:
    In my String class, I used a vector of strings to represent each element in the 
    string. Using a vector of strings or just a string as the attribute that stores the 
    actual string would work. The main reason i used a vector was because I was more familiar with
    operations of amending a vector rather than a string. There was possible added complexity as each time I would
    want to add an individual character, I would create a temporary string variable, append the character to the temporary
    string, and then append the string.
